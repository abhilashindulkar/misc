## Kyverno
[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/) is an open-source, Kubernetes-native policy engine that helps you define, validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources using policies written in YAML, without needing to learn a separate programming language like Rego (used by OPA).

## Vcluster
[vCluster](https://www.vcluster.com/docs?_gl=1*jjn6ff*_gcl_au*Mjk3MzA0NzQ1LjE3NTE2MjkxNDc.*_ga*NTgwMDI4MzI0LjE3NTE2MjkxNDg.*_ga_4RQQZ3WGE9*czE3NTE4ODcwMzQkbzMkZzEkdDE3NTE4ODcxODIkajU0JGwwJGgxOTQ1Nzk5MzY1) is an open-source tool that allows you to create virtual Kubernetes clusters that run inside a host (physical) Kubernetes cluster.
It is developed and maintained by Loft Labs. It provides multi-tenancy, environment isolation, and cluster-level separation without the overhead of spinning up new physical clusters.
