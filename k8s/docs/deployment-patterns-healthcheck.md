### What are Deployment Patterns? 
Deployment patterns are strategies used to manage the release and deployment of software in a controlled and systematic way. They ensure that new changes are efficiently integrated into production environments while maintaining stability and reliability. 

### Why Include Application Health Checks? 
Application health checks are used to monitor the status and performance of applications. These checks are crucial for: 

Error detection and recovery: a healthy API shouldn’t return errors and exceptions. A health check can identify abnormal behavior like this. 
Load balancing: Ensuring that traffic is only sent to healthy instances. 
Auto Scaling: Scaling the application based on its health and demands. 
Availability – by sending regular requests to API endpoints to verify they are accessible. 
Functionality – by sending requests using specific inputs to check these return the expected responses. 
Performance – by tracking response times, measuring the latency to identify any slowdowns or performance bottlenecks. 
 
 Common Deployment Patterns Integrated with Health Checks 
1. Blue/Green Deployment
Technical Overview: 

Setup: Maintain two identical environments: Blue (current production) and Green (new version). 
Execution: Deploy the new release to the Green environment while Blue continues handling production traffic. 
Health Checks: Implement comprehensive health checks on the Green environment. These would typically include system-level checks (CPU, memory usage), service-level checks (response times, error rates), and application-specific checks (feature functionalities). 
Switching Traffic: 

Gradual Cutover: Once the Green environment passes all health checks, begin traffic cutover. This can be done using a load balancer or via DNS switching. 
Monitoring: Continuously monitor the Green environment as the traffic load increases. Watch for performance degradations or errors. 
Fallback Plan: 

If the Green environment shows unexpected behaviors or fails the health checks after traffic cutover, quickly revert to the Blue environment. 

2. Canary Deployment
Technical Overview: 

Phased Release: Start by deploying the new version (Canary) to a small subset of your infrastructure. 
Health Checks: Perform the same health checks as Blue/Green, but with additional focus on comparing the performance metrics between the Canary and the stable production environment. 
Evaluation: 

User Behavior & Feedback: Analyze user interactions and feedback for any signs of malfunction. 
Gradual Scale Up: If the Canary version performs well under increasing load, gradually increase the percentage of traffic it handles. 
Risk Mitigation: 

Use automated tools for real-time performance monitoring and anomaly detection. Rollback immediately if anomalies surpass a certain threshold. 

3. Rolling Deployment
Technical Overview: 

Update in Waves: Update servers or service instances in groups to minimize the interruption. 
Health Checks: After upgrading each group, run intensive health checks. Make sure the updated instances perform as expected before proceeding to the next set. 
Concurrency and Capacity: 

Maintain surplus capacity to handle the same level of traffic with fewer active instances during the update. 
Use load balancers to divert traffic away from updating instances during the process. 
Recovery Strategy: 

Automate a quick rollback for any group of instances where health checks indicate failure. 

4. A/B Testing:
Technical Overview: 

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of an application to determine which one performs better. Unlike traditional deployment patterns that primarily focus on reliability and error reduction, A/B testing aims to experiment with feature variations to optimize user engagement, conversion rates, and overall performance 

Employing Health Checks 
Initial Checks: Before going live, perform standard health checks on both versions, including: 
System metrics (e.g., CPU, memory usage) 
Application metrics (e.g., response times, error rates) 
Feature-specific checks (e.g., functionality of the new feature in Version B) 
Continuous Monitoring: During the A/B test, continuously monitor the application's health to ensure both versions perform stably under real-world conditions. This involves: 
Real-time monitoring of system and application metrics. 
Logging any errors or issues and analyzing them for insights. 
User feedback mechanisms for issue reporting. 
Managing Traffic and User Exposure 
Segmentation: Direct only a portion of the user traffic to the new version (B) while the rest continues using the current version (A). This segmentation can be based on user demographics, behavior, or random selection. 
Load Handling: Ensure both versions handle traffic effectively without degradation in performance. Load balancers should be configured to manage user requests dynamically based on system health. 
Implementing Effective Health Checks 
Granularity: 

System Level: Verify that hardware resources and OS metrics are within normal ranges. 
Service Level: APIs and internal services must return correct and timely responses. 
Application Level: Features must operate correctly; consider user journey tests that mimic real user actions. 
Tools Supporting These Patterns with Health Checks
Kubernetes: Offers health checks through liveness and readiness probes. Supports patterns like blue/green or canary deployments with rollbacks. 
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Elastic Container Service, AWS CodeDeploy: Supports rolling updates and health-based deployments. 
Azure DevOps: Offers feature flags, ring deployments, and health checks integrations. 
Use tools like Prometheus for monitoring metrics, combined with Grafana for dashboard visualizations. 
Use automated scripts or CI/CD pipeline tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions to trigger health checks post-deployment and manage promotions or rollbacks based on the outcomes. 

### Best Practices
Comprehensive Health Checks: Include checks for web server metrics, database connections, external dependencies, and application-specific metrics. 
Monitoring and Analytics: Always monitor the application health data to predict issues before they affect deployments. 
Automation & ongoing Optimization: Automate the rollback process in case of failed health checks during deployment. 
Simulate Failures: Regularly perform chaos engineering experiments to ensure that your deployment strategy and health checks can handle unexpected failures. 


These patterns, integrated with systematic health checks, help maintain the balance between rapid deployment and high availability, ensuring a smooth user experience. Implementing these strategies requires a good understanding of both the deployment technologies and the application architecture to tailor the health checks accurately.
