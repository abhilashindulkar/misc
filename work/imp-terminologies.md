## High Availability 
A system's ability to remain accessible and operational with minimal downtime, even in the event of hardware or software failures. Achieving high availability typically involves using redundancy, load balancing, and failover mechanisms to ensure continuous service and quick recovery from disruptions. It is a key design goal for critical applications in cloud environments to meet service-level agreements (SLAs) and maintain user trust. 

## Fault tolerance
The capability of a system or service to continue operating with the same performance, despite the failure of one or more of its components. This feature is achieved through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and the distribution of workloads across multiple instances, availability zones, or regions, ensuring minimal downtime and data integrity in the event of unexpected disruptions. 

## Resilience
It refers to the system’s ability to recover quickly and maintain continuous operations in the face of disruptions, such as hardware failures, network issues, or large-scale outages. It includes features like automated failover, data replication, and scalable architecture, ensuring minimal downtime and data integrity even under adverse conditions. 

## Reliability
The system’s ability to consistently perform its intended functions despite various potential issues, such as hardware or network failures. This capability ensures that applications and services remain available and maintain functionality under disruptive conditions. Achieving reliability in the cloud involves best practices like using redundant infrastructure, automated failure recovery, continuous monitoring, and robust disaster recovery strategies, which altogether ensure minimal downtime and high availability.
