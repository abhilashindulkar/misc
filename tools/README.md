# Kubernetes

## Kyverno
[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/) is an open-source, Kubernetes-native policy engine that helps you define, validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources using policies written in YAML, without needing to learn a separate programming language like Rego (used by OPA).

## Vcluster
[vCluster](https://www.vcluster.com/docs?_gl=1*jjn6ff*_gcl_au*Mjk3MzA0NzQ1LjE3NTE2MjkxNDc.*_ga*NTgwMDI4MzI0LjE3NTE2MjkxNDg.*_ga_4RQQZ3WGE9*czE3NTE4ODcwMzQkbzMkZzEkdDE3NTE4ODcxODIkajU0JGwwJGgxOTQ1Nzk5MzY1) is an open-source tool that allows you to create virtual Kubernetes clusters that run inside a host (physical) Kubernetes cluster.
It is developed and maintained by Loft Labs. It provides multi-tenancy, environment isolation, and cluster-level separation without the overhead of spinning up new physical clusters. 

## kubectx
[kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) is a tool to switch between contexts (clusters) on kubectl faster. kubens is a tool to switch between Kubernetes namespaces (and configure them for kubectl) easily.


# Terraform

## opetofu
[opentofu](https://opentofu.org/) is a reliable, flexible, community-driven infrastructure as code tool under the Linux Foundation's stewardship. It serves as a drop-in replacement for Terraform, preserving your existing workflows and configurations.

## terragrunt
[terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) is a flexible orchestration tool that allows Infrastructure as Code to scale. It keeps code/configs/arguments DRY.

## terraform-docs
[terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/introduction/) is a command-line utility designed to automatically generate documentation from Terraform modules. It helps maintain consistent and up-to-date documentation for your infrastructure as code, particularly for reusable modules. 

## tfsec
[tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec) uses static analysis of your terraform code to spot potential misconfigurations & security issues.

## tflint
[TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) is an open-source static analysis tool specifically designed for Terraform configurations. Its primary purpose is to improve the quality, consistency, and reliability of Terraform code by identifying potential issues, errors, and violations of best practices. 

## infracost
[Infracost](https://github.com/infracost/infracost) is an open-source tool designed to provide cloud cost estimates for infrastructure defined using Terraform. It helps engineers and FinOps teams understand the financial implications of their infrastructure changes before they are applied, enabling informed decision-making and cost optimization.
